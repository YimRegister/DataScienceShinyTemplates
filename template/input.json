This lesson is about language – how it’s used to communicate, topics people tend to talk about most, and how language can be scored as positive or negative. We can even try to figure out what emotions people are having through how they type! Language analysis is used for sorting topics, moderating violence, and even detecting depression. This is complicated because it’s very hard to use Data Science to determine how someone is really feeling. We need to be careful about knowing what Data Science can and cannot do for us.",
