 "introtext": "How do social media face filters know where your face is? Why is face detection a controversial topic? AI technology has been criticized for being used for harsher policing, perpetuating gender and race bias, and is sometimes used without people’s consent or knowledge! Age and emotion recognition can be faulty, misclassifying people for age restrictions or hiring purposes. It can also be used to target ads to your specific demographic. While face filter effects are fun, and there are a few useful applications of face recognition, there seem to be much more problems than solutions. Let’s explore.",
